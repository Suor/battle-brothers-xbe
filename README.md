# More Backgrounds and Events (Updated)

*This mod was created by CleverFool and then updated for compatibility, cleaned of some bugs and rebalanced by me. The original is available [here][original].*

This is a content mod for Battle Brothers that seeks to make events and hiring brothers fresh and fun for those that are getting a bit bored of the hiring process, or are just looking for additional content.

Features:

- 36 new backgrounds to hire
- 54 new events
- 4 new custom starts
- 4 new legendary items with custom art
- a couple of new mechanics to make hiring more interesting and finding standout brothers of all backgrounds more viable (via separate mods, see below)

To put it simply the goal of this mod is to break Cripple to Brawler to whatever to Hedge Knight progression, which eventually boils down to rounding out the roster with characters from a select few backgrounds. Apart from adding to a sheer variety I suggest several strategies implemented as mods:

[Starting Perks by Background (Updated)][bgperks] - gives brothers a chance to begin with certain perks in the perk tree unlocked by default depending on the background they belong to. However, once you install both mods it starts to work for all backgrounds both vanilla and the ones from here. *The original mod has this built in, here it goes separate.*

[Hackflow's Perks][hackperks] - my curated collection of 6 new perks in the spirit of less is more approach. If both this and the previous mod are installed then these perks will also be sometimes unlocked at start.

[Elite Few - Master Bros (Updated)][elitefew] - makes some bros "masters" with max attribute rolls, an extra talent and no bad traits.

The basic idea is that cheaper and more available backgrounds translating into more rolls will by law of large numbers and random allow you to fish for standout bros not only amongst Hedge Knights and such.

*NOTE. The original mod provides a "standout attribute" mechanic, i.e. a chance to have a bonus on top of usual range for some attribute defined by background. I chose to replace that with Elite Few - Master Bros, which fulfils the same function in a more creative manner.*

*NOTE2. The original author also intended for "more legendary items to hunt for and late-game events and encounters to use them on", I suggest [Camps and Artifacts (Reworked)][camps] to fill this  niche somewhat.*

*NOTE3. The mods above not only play nice together but also work separately in any combination.*

## Compatibility

Safe to add midgame, can't remove. Should be highly compatible with other mods.

- **Reforged** - ok, but all new backgrounds will have simply random perk trees, not tailored to a background at hand.
- **Legends** - untested.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir. Requires [modhooks][].
